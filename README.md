## Technical Assessment Challenge

### Playfair Cipher Solver

#### Challenge
Your goal is to build an application that can solve a Playfair Cipher. To learn more about Playfair Ciphers and how they are constructed, consult the following Wikipedia page on the subject: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher).

Ideally this challenge should be able to be completed in 3 hours or less. I used typescript programming languages to complete this challenge:
- TypeScript


Ensure your code is properly commented and formatted for readability and ease-of-understanding.

#### Thematics
*"Attention spy network! You've been assigned a task of the utmost importance! We've received an encrypted message from an agent in the field containing the password to a top secret club for super spies. The encrypted message reads as follows: **"IKEWENENXLNQLPZSLERUMRHEERYBOFNEINCHCV"**. We've been told if we can crack this code and give the password to the door-person at the corner of 32nd Street, we will gain access to the illustrious spy club **Spy City**! We must get inside! However the password has been encrypted with an older system known as a **Playfair Cipher**. Our agent in the field says the key to the cipher is the string **"SUPERSPY"**. However, for the life of us we cannot crack this code! Devise an application that can solve this encryption, get the password, and join us inside Spy City for what we are sure will be a night to remember!"*
